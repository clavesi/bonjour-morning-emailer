## How It Works
The program scrapes the web for:
- A word of the day
- The newest SciShow video
- A fun fact
- A person born on this day
- A photo from NASA
- An event that happened on this day
- Top stories from Reuters

then it updates a spreadsheet and sends an email back with all the information

## Directory Guide
- main.py (main file to run everything)
- scraper.py (scrapes the web for all the info)
- spreadsheet.py (fills out a spreadsheet with scraper.py's info)
- html_changer.py (changes the html file to send as email)
- email_server.py (sends the email)
- settings.py (file to place email information and sheet to access)
- client_secret.json (file that verifies and allows access to spreadsheet)
